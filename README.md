# 2nd Chance Games

## Description
```
My project is a card gallery of 11 games that I think could be played today with little to no issues and still be quite enjoyable.

This is of course my opinion.  The first card is the main card and I am still working to make the other cardsthe same as it.

I utilizied BootStrap to help with responsiveness and to build the card gallery.  I had built the card layout but could not get the responsiveness to work, so I switched over to BootStrap and jquery.

The first card, "Super Mario World," is the main card I designed all of the other cards around.  

I'm still working on adding content to the other cards but all of the buttons link to external websites when selected and the dropdown pulls games by the ID.  I was not able to get the dropdown to hide systems when you selected one from the dropdown.

## Custom jQuery Function
```
The jQuery function I created changes the title text when you mouseover it in order to read the title easier.  It changes back to red in order to bring your attention back to the title.
