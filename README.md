# 2nd Chance Games

## Description
```
My project is a card gallery of 11 games that I think could be played today with little to no issues and still be quite enjoyable.

This is of course my opinion.  The first card is the main card and I am still working to make the other cardsthe same as it.

I utilizied BootStrap to help with responsiveness and to build the card gallery.
